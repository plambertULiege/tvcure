## Introduction
The _*tvcure*_ package enables to fit additive cure survival model with exogenous time-varying covariates (Lambert \& Kreyenfeld, 2025) [1,2].

The starting point is the bounded cumulative hazard model (also name the *promotion time* model) (Tsodikov 1998) with population survival function
$$S_p(t|\mathbf{v}) = \exp\{-H_p(t|\mathbf{v})\} =\exp\{-{\vartheta(\mathbf{v})} F(t)\},$$ 
bounded hazard $H_p(t|\mathbf{v})$ and cure fraction $\pi(\mathbf{v})=S_p(+\infty|\mathbf{v})=\exp\{-{\vartheta(\mathbf{v})}\}$, see Figure 1.
Function $F(t)$ is a c.d.f. governing the population hazard dynamics, with $F(0)=1$ and $F(T)=1$ where $T$ is the minimum value of time after which an event-free unit is considered cured.

The extended promotion model (Bremhorst and Lambert 2016) additionally allows the event dynamics governed by $F(t)$ to change with covariates $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$,
$$S_p(t|\mathbf{v},\tilde{\mathbf{v}}) = \exp\{-H_p(t|\mathbf{v},\tilde{\mathbf{v}})\} =\exp\{-{\vartheta(\mathbf{v})} {F(t|\tilde{\mathbf{v}})}\}$$

For categorical covariates ${\mathbf z}$ and continuous covariates ${\mathbf x}$, the following additive long-term survival submodel defining the cure probability is assumed,
$\vartheta(\mathbf{v})= -\log \pi(\mathbf{v}) =\exp\{\eta_\vartheta(\mathbf{v})\}$
where
$\eta_\vartheta(\mathbf{v}) = \beta_0 + {\pmb \beta}^\top{\mathbf z} + \sum_j f_j(x_j)$,
a positive value for $\beta_k$ suggesting an event probability increasing with $z_k$ and, consequently, a cure probability decreasing with $z_k$.
The event dynamics is governed by the additive short-term submodel,
$F(t|\tilde{\mathbf{v}}) = 1-S_0(t)^{\exp(\eta_F(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}))}$,
where $\eta_F(\tilde{\mathbf{v}})= {\pmb{\gamma}}^\top\tilde{\mathbf{z}} + \sum_j \tilde{f}_j(\tilde{x}_j)$,
a positive value for $\gamma_k$ suggesting an acceleration of event timing with $z_k$,  see Bremhorst, Kreyenfeld \& Lambert (2019). The baseline density function $f_0(t)=-{d\over dt}S_0(t)$ and the additive terms are specified using Bayesian P-splines. The model is identifiable provided that the follow-up is sufficiently long to display the plateau in the population survival function (Lambert \& Bremhorst, 2019).

The core contribution in Lambert and Kreyenfeld (2025) is an extension of that model to include exogenous time-varying covariates.
The model specification starts with the population hazard function from which other quantities can be obtained:
 $$h_p(t|\mathbf{v}(t),\tilde{\mathbf{v}}(t)) = \vartheta(\mathbf{v}(t)) f(t|\tilde{\mathbf{v}}(t)) = \mathrm{e}^{\eta_\vartheta(\mathbf{v}(t))+\eta_F(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}(t))} f_0(t)S_0(t)^{\exp(\eta_F(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}(t))-1}$$ 
In the special case where covariates are constant, we return to the preceding extended promotion time model with static covariates.

The combination of **Laplace approximations** and of **Bayesian P-splines** (named *LPS*) enable fast and flexible inference in a Bayesian framework (Lambert \& Gressani, 2023). The Gaussian Markov field prior assumed for the penalized spline parameters and the Bernstein-von Mises theorem provide reliable Laplace approximation to the posterior distribution of these quantities.

## The *tvcure* package in action

Let us illustrate the use of the *tvcure* package on simulated right-censored data:

```{r tvcure0}
## Package installation and loading
## install.packages("devtools")
## devtools::install_github("plambertULiege/tvcure")
library(tvcure) 
	
## Data simulation
beta = c(beta0=.4, beta1=-.2, beta2=.15) ; gam = c(gam1=.2, gam2=.2)
data = simulateTVcureData(n=500, seed=123, beta=beta, gam=gam,
                        RC.dist="exponential",mu.cens=550)$rawdata
round(head(data),3)
```

The data frame should always have a counting process form and contain at least the following entries:

* id: the ⁠id of the unit associated to the data in a given line in the data frame.

* time: ⁠ ⁠the integer time at which the observations are reported. For a given unit, it should be a sequence of **consecutive** integers starting at 1 for the first observation. 

* event : ⁠ ⁠a sequence of 0-1 event indicators. For the lines corresponding to a given unit, it starts with 0 values concluded by a 0 in case of right-censoring or by a 1 if the event is observed at the end of the follow-up.


### Model fitting
Let us fit a double additive tvcure model to these data with:

* categorical covariates $z_1, z_2$ and continous covariates $x_1$ and $x_2$ entering in an additive way in the long-term survival submodel ;

* categorical covariates $z_3, z_4$ and continous covariates $x_3$ and $x_4$ entering in an additive way in the short-term survival submodel.

```{r tvcure1a}
model = tvcure(~z1+z2+s(x1)+s(x2),
               ~z3+z4+s(x3)+s(x4), data=data)
print(model)
```

The estimated reference hazard $\mathrm{e}^{\beta_0}f_0(t)$ and the associated c.d.f. function $F_0(t)$ governing the baseline dynamics of the cumulative hazard can also visualized,
```{r tvcure1b1, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
plot(model, select=0, pages=1)
```
as well as the estimated additive terms in the long-term survival submodel,
```{r tvcure1b2, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
plot(model, select=c(1,2), pages=1) ## First 2 additive terms in the model
```
or in the short-term survival submodel,
```{r tvcure1b3, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
plot(model, select=c(3,4), pages=1) ## Last 2 additive terms in the model
```

It is possible to force the additive terms to be zero for selected reference values for the covariates, which facilitates the interpretation of the other model parameters:
```{r tvcure1c}
model = tvcure(~z1+z2+s(x1,ref=.75)+s(x2,ref=.5), 
               ~z3+z4+s(x3,ref=.75)+s(x4,ref=.5), data=data)
plot(model, select=1:4, pages=1) ## The 4 additive terms in the model
```

### Predictions
Predictions can be made for a given history of covariate values. Consider for example unit 1 for which no event was observed by the end of the follow-up:
```{r tvcure2a}
data1 = subset(data, data$id==1) ## Data for unit 1
round(tail(data1, n=1),3) ## Data at the last observation time
```
The estimated population survival function of a subject sharing the same covariate history can be computed and visualized,
```{r tvcure2b}
obj = predict(model, ci.level=0.95, newdata=data1)
matplot(obj$Sp, ylim=c(0,1),
        type="l", lty=c(1,2,2), col=1, las=1,
        xlab="time", ylab=bquote(S[p](t)))
grid(lwd=.5,lty=1)
```

with the last value providing the estimated cure probability (with credible bounds):
```{r tvcure2c}
print(tail(obj$Sp,n=1)) ## Cure probability
```

More details can be found in Lambert \& Kreyenfeld (2025) and in the documentation of the *tvcure* package.
