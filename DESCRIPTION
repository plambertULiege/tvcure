Description: Fit of a double additive cure survival model with time-varying covariates. The additive terms in the long- and short-term survival submodels, modelling the cure probability and the event timing for susceptible units, are estimated using Laplace P-splines. For more details, see Lambert and Kreyenfeld (2025) <doi:10.1093/jrsssa/qnaf035>.
